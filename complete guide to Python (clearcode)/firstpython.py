# and the next part "lean python by making games"
# is on udemy
# https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-python-by-making-games/
# so it thought I'd go through the youtube part before buying it

# websites that can run python (and others) online:
# programiz.com...i don't actually see the interactive shell demonstrated in the video but i don't need it anyway
# also replit.com
