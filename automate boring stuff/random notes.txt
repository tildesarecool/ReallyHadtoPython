Python has concept of "truthy" and "fasley" like data types
bool(0) is "falsey"

0 and 0.0 are "falsey"

Python visualizer looks like a good helper site

use sys.exit to super hard exit out program

I got through the playlist on youtube and switched over to the playlist on udemy that I apparently paid for
https://www.udemy.com/course/automate/learn/lecture/3465844

The youtube playlist actually had identical videos to that of the first 6 sections of the udemy course
so I'm starting on section 6 video 16 "similarities between lists and strings"

I also switched from my (lenovo) laptop to my (alienware) main laptop 
so I probably have to add 

turns out section 6 video 16 "similarities between lists and strings" actually was in the youtube playlist
I just didn't remember/realize
I think i need to review it anyway

name = 'Zophie a cat'
newName = name[0:7] + 'the' + name[8:12]
newName
# oputput:
'Zophie the cat'

spam = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
cheese = spam
cheese[1] = 'Hello'
cheese
#output:
[0, 'Hello', 2, 3, 4, 5]


immutable versus mutable values
from what i can gather one can't have values modified in place
and the other can
I'm not sure yet and how is relevant. 
The video does talk about "references" though 
so it seems like a form pointer/past by reference. Or is literally that.
