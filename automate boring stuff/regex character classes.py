# { } = match specific number of times
# { } w/ some number matches minimum and max number of times
# leaving out first or seond number in curly braces says there is no min or max
# "greedy" matching will match logest string possible

chia-plotter (pipelined multi-threaded)
This is a new implementation of a chia plotter which is designed as a processing pipeline, similar to how GPUs work, only the "cores" are normal software CPU threads.

As a result this plotter is able to fully max out any storage device's bandwidth, simply by increasing the number of "cores", ie. threads.

Usage
Join the Discord for support: https://discord.gg/pQwkebKnPB

For <poolkey> and <farmerkey> see output of `chia keys show`.
To plot for pools, specify <contract> address via -c instead of <poolkey>, see `chia plotnft show`.
<tmpdir> needs about 220 GiB space, it will handle about 25% of all writes. (Examples: './', '/mnt/tmp/')
<tmpdir2> needs about 110 GiB space and ideally is a RAM drive, it will handle about 75% of all writes.
Combined (tmpdir + tmpdir2) peak disk usage is less than 256 GiB.
In case of <count> != 1, you may press Ctrl-C for graceful termination after current plot is finished,
or double press Ctrl-C to terminate immediately.

Usage:
  chia_plot [OPTION...]

  -k, --size arg       K size (default = 32, k <= 32)
  -x, --port arg       Network port (default = 8444, chives = 9699)
  -n, --count arg      Number of plots to create (default = 1, -1 = infinite)
  -r, --threads arg    Number of threads (default = 4)
  -u, --buckets arg    Number of buckets (default = 256)
  -v, --buckets3 arg   Number of buckets for phase 3+4 (default = buckets)
  -t, --tmpdir arg     Temporary directory, needs ~220 GiB (default = $PWD)
  -2, --tmpdir2 arg    Temporary directory 2, needs ~110 GiB [RAM] (default = <tmpdir>)
  -d, --finaldir arg   Final directory (default = <tmpdir>)
  -w, --waitforcopy    Wait for copy to start next plot
  -p, --poolkey arg    Pool Public Key (48 bytes)
  -c, --contract arg   Pool Contract Address (62 chars)
  -f, --farmerkey arg  Farmer Public Key (48 bytes)
  -G, --tmptoggle      Alternate tmpdir/tmpdir2 (default = false)
  -D, --directout      Create plot directly in finaldir (default = false)
  -K, --rmulti2 arg    Thread multiplier for P2 (default = 1)
      --help           Print help
Make sure to crank up <threads> if you have plenty of cores, the default is 4. Depending on the phase more threads will be launched, the setting is just a multiplier.

RAM usage depends on <threads> and <buckets>. With the new default of 256 buckets it's about 0.5 GB per thread at most.

-G option will alternate the temp dirs used while plotting to give each one, tmpdir and tmpdir2, equal usage. The first plot creation will use tmpdir and tmpdir2 as expected. The next run, if -n equals 2 or more, will swap the order to tmpdir2 and tmpdir. The next run swaps again to tmpdir and tmpdir2. This will occur until the number of plots created is reached or until stopped.

RAM disk setup on Linux
sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=110G tmpfs /mnt/ram/

Note: 128 GiB System RAM minimum required for RAM disk.

How to Verify
To make sure the plots are valid you can use the ProofOfSpace tool from chiapos:

git clone https://github.com/Chia-Network/chiapos.git
cd chiapos && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j8
./ProofOfSpace check -f plot-k32-???.plot [num_iterations]
How to update to latest version
cd chia-plotter
git checkout master
git pull
git submodule update --init
./make_devel.sh
Future Plans
I do have some history with GPU mining, back in 2014 I was the first to open source a XPM GPU miner, which was about 40x more efficient than the CPU miner. See my other repos.

As such, it's only a matter of time until I add OpenCL support to speed up the plotter even more, keeping most of the load off the CPUs.
